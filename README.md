# Simon

### by Desiree Joya

- This game was made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS

- To create this project I started with a wireframe and pseudocode. I created an HTML page and styled it with CSS to resemble a classic Simon toy. I added my Javascript and began to work on the logic and functionality of a game of simon. I tested, refactored, and deployed it to Github pages.
